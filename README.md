 Ingredient
============

A test based environment configuration utility
----------------------------------------------

Ingredient is a utility that configures a user's environment based on ingredient files. Ingredient files contain information on how to configure the user's environment to use a particular version of a software package. In addition, ingredient files also contain basic and advanced tests (known as "tasting" for simple sanity checks and "noming" for complex system integration tests) to ensure that the environment specified by the ingredient file is working correctly for the end user as well as providing utility for performing a system wide test of all software packages configured with ingredient.
